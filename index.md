## Project Idea<br/>
**_Assisted living,_**<br/>
**_Assistive technology_**<br/>
<br/>
Our project idea is to create an application for the family of patients with Alzheimer's. This application will be aimed towards both the families and the patients, for the sake of increasing the standard of living for the patient, and minimizing burden upon the family. Our application is focusing on mild Alzheimer's Disease (early stage), who suffers from common difficulties including issues with remembering names, words, and increasing trouble with planning. We expect this application to be used in the daily lives of the family to provide the following functionalities for the patient and caregivers.<br/>
We expect this app to be used by informal caregivers alongside patients daily and we also expect the app to have the following functionalities.
  - **Journal:** Saving Memories. The journal, updated by all members, will provide loving memories of the family in the past and present.
  - **Reminders:** Notifications that are posted by the family members/caretakers to remind the patient about their current affairs.
  - **Memory Prompting:** As Alzheimer's progress, language, reasoning, and processing are all affected. This affects the ability of the patient to remember certain words and names. Our application will use pictures to help the patient select certain words, or allow the patient to verbally describe the object they are trying to name, and provide a list of object names they may be referring to.
  - **Brain Game:** Based on saved memories, it would prompt the patient to describe certain details about a memory.
  - **Permission-Based Viewing:** Not all family members need all the information. Check out the options for the devices that need certain info, or that don’t need all in the information.
      - **Revoking and granting access:** A primary admin will be able to assign/reassign appropriate rolls according to their liking.
  - **Information Portal:** The application provides critical information to the patient and the family.
    Including details such as the closest hospitals, information on dealing with Alzheimer’s Disease, and how to ensure mental health and stability as caregivers, the portal will provide links for any questions any stakeholders may have.

## Stakeholders and Users
  - Developers/Designers
      - the developers and designers will need lots of training to be able to implement this app to the best
        of their abilities, using research and IDEO methods. Their background knowledge may consist of personal background,
        but also secondary research from creating the best product possible. They will be the main people involved in the
        User-Centered Design, other than the users themselves.
  - Sponsors of project
      - Sponsors will have no training, and very little background knowledge. They will not be part of the design process.
  - Healthcare (Doctors/Nurses)
      - Healthcare Agents have extensive knowledge, but will not have any training of the application as it is not designed for them. As such, they will not play a part in the User-Centered Design.
  - Patient suffering from Alzheimer's Disease
      - The patient will have little to moderate background knowledge on Alzheimer’s Disease, as the condition becomes a big part of their life. They will have extensive training/experience with the application, as we hope the platform will provide daily support in their lives. The patient relates to the design of the system as the main character of the User-Centered Design, being the problem in the investigation phase, and being centered for solutions in the ideate phase.
  - Family/Caretakers
      - Informal
          - Informal Caregivers, consisting of family members, will range from having little to extensive knowledge on Alzheimer’s Disease, as they help support the patient. They will receive extensive training/experience with the application, as they are the main targeted users. Other than the patients themselves, the design of the application will be targeted towards the informal caregivers such that it provides maximum usability. As such, for all phases of the User-Centered Design, they will be considered.
      - Formal
          - Formal Caregivers, consisting of social workers and occupational therapists, will have extensive knowledge on dealing with patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease, but they will not receive much training for the application, as they are not a targeted group of users. As such, they will not really be considered for the design process.
      - Professional (Doctor/Nurses)
          - See above at Healthcare.


## User Research Methods <br/>
The two main research methods we used were Interviews and Secondary Research.
We allotted a small amount of time to research Competitive Product Survey in order to find current
markets for products, goals that these applications try to solve, and what functionalities they provide.<br/>
### Interviews <br/>

Interview method was chosen in order to be able to ascertain characteristics of informal and formal caregivers, and
also to view perceptions of users on the patients and the burden placed on them. We were able to interview four
individuals composing of formal and informal caregivers. Using the Zarit Burden Interview, we were able to place the
burden of taking care of a patient with Alzheimer’s Disease upon the caretakers in the moderate range. The main problem
we are trying to face now would be: **How to lower user’s burden through our functionalities?**
<br/>Using these four interviewees, we were able to paint a picture on which functionalities were useful, which seemed
useless, and provide understanding through the user’s view on how the application may increase or decrease the amount
of burden placed on the user. Another point that we asked our interviewees was, due to the nature of the condition,
whether or not the patient themselves should have the functionalities. Most of the functionalities should also be
possessed by the patient.
<br/>Discussing burden, the majority of the functionalities would lower the burden. However the
following two functionalities would increase burden placed.
- Patient Paging Ability
    - The caretakers believed that this ability would increase the burden. They believed that this ability would be misused constantly. Therefore, the users suggested the ability to turn on/off the feature.
- Panic Button
    - Just like the paging ability, the caregivers believed the button may be overused, causing stress levels of caregivers to increase.

### Use of Interview Method

The interview method went very smoothly, and we were able to gather a lot of data through using both structured
and opened questions. The only difficulty with the interview method was when we used open structure of asking questions
about the functionalities, we still had to guide the interviewee such that they understood exactly what we were expecting
from the functionality - if not, they gave vague answers that did not provide much useful information. Hence, next
time, there may be more benefit to include a more detailed description for the caretaker before we ask open questions.

### Secondary Research
<a href="https://github.com/lafffta/lumenary/blob/master/Research/Secondary%20Research/Secondary%20research.pdf">Download research document</a><br/>
Secondary Research was chosen due to the groups inexperience with patients suffering from Alzheimer’s Disease,
and lack of knowledge of the disease itself. Hence, we required Secondary Research to develop a point of view on
the subject and design issues. The secondary research conducted has been instrumental in forming a more educated
perspective on the landscape of problems caregivers and patients afflicted with Alzheimer's disease face.
    The first listed source compares the benefits of various ICT interventions on informal caregivers of people living
with dementia (of which Alzheimer's disease is the most common form). This study is directly relevant to our application,
and also highlights a number of phone services currently available to people in these situations.
    The second source provided some statistics about the demographic of caregivers and people suffering from dementia.
    The third source gave good information about assisted living settings. This is mainly pertaining to formal caregivers
in these assisted living homes, but also brings to light some potential issues we could address with our application.

### Use of Secondary Research<br/>
Overall, the secondary research method has been effective in providing general information about the people our app
could be used by. However, it is still hard to confirm our proposed functionality would be useful with purely secondary
research. Thus, we also did interviews with informal caregivers to get direct feedback on our ideas. We will likely
continue to use sources like these when evaluating more specific functions later on.

### Competitive Product Survey<br/>
<a href="https://github.com/lafffta/lumenary/blob/master/Research/Secondary%20Research/Competitive%20Product%20Survey.pdf">Download Informal Caregiver-1 Interview</a><br/>
Competitive Product Survey was used in order to collect, compare and conduct evaluations of the product’s
competitions. We used the information gathered to establish certain functionalities and how they compare to our
own, and to also compare the goals of different apps to ours. The applications tried to directly solve a certain
problem that patients face such as:
- Big fonts and calendars to deal with the inability to read small fonts.
- Location services to deal with wandering.
- Timed Pillboxes to ensure medicine is taken at a timely manner.<br/>
We have taken this information and the goals of the applications in order to ensure that our application
will have all the necessary functionalities to maintain the patients standard of living. While the information
provided from this research method mainly shed light on applications to patients with Alzheimer’s Disease, our
application will be strongly focused towards the informal caregivers.


### Use of Competitive Product Survey<br/>
Due to the nature of our product, since we have a differing main audience, the information gathered
using this method was not very helpful. As this was a by-product of secondary research however, not
much time was allotted to this method, hence if we did the project again, it would be acceptable to contain
this method as long as it was not the primary or secondary research method.

## Task Descriptions
1. Setting up a Reminder<br/>
The Primary Caretaker logs into application, goes into Reminders, and sets reminder. Application asks for name of reminder, description, time, date, and if reminder is recurring or one time only. Once all information has been filled in, user presses save, or cancel if they decide reminder is not needed.<br/>
2. Adding a Journal entry<br/>
User opens the journal page and a calendar opens up with the current date highlighted. The user can then press on the day they want to add an entry to and the application will take them to another screen with all the entries associated to that day. the user then presses on “Add Entry” and is taken to another screen where they enter in a title, picture and/or files (optional), location (optional), time of day(optional), date(if differing from date selected),and a description of the the memory they want to save. Once the user has finished entering all the information they can proceed to press the Save button where the entry will show up on the day they saved the entry on. <br/>
3. Editing Journal Entry<br/>
The user presses the day and entry they want to edit, they press the edit icon where it takes them to a page similar to journal entry page with all of the fields filled out. User can then choose whatever they want to add, subtract or change. After user has finished with the changes they submit save, a prompt comes up making sure they want to confirm the changes if the user agrees the entry will now show the correct information.<br/>
4. Editing Reminder<br/>
User goes into the reminders screen and can choose from all the saved reminders. When the user presses the desired reminder, Reminder details show up, like the description. From there the user can click the edit button and go into the set-up reminder screen, with all the fields filled. The user can then change all their information, then press save to save the changes. A prompt will pop up to confirm any changes that the user did was intentional once the user confirms it was then the reminder will now display the correct information. <br/>
5. Playing Brain Game<br/>
The user goes to the brain game portal and can choose from a number of cards each one representing a game of some sort. The user chooses the game they want and can start playing right away. There will be an icon on the top left to go back to the game portal to choose another card or function.<br/>
6. Accessing Information Portal<br/>
The user goes to the information portal icon where they can read about certain information related to the Alzheimer’s Disease. In this section the user will be able to find basic information regarding the nature of the disease, possible treatments and medicines known to have been used to treat its symptoms and a tab containing FAQ about Alzheimer. Additionally to the side or bottom of the window, the user can navigate to some external links that contain further information and support regarding the nature and different treatments of the decease.<br/>
7. Accessing External sources of information from Information Portal<br/>
User will access from the main window of the information portal a small tab that allows the user to navigate to a different window containing a list of compiled websites that contain and offer information and support. Each website name will be accompanied with a link to the website the user wants to navigate to. By clicking on this link the user will be send to the main website containing the desired information.
