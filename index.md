## Identify your project idea. Succinctly describe the nature of the project, how you expect your system to be used, by whom, and the context under which you expect it to be used.

**_Assisted living_**

**_Assistive technology_**

Our project idea is to create a mobile application for patients with Alzheimer’s disease and also their family members (informal caregivers). Maintaining their standard of living prior to contracting the disease is the core of what we want to accomplish. The app will be mainly focusing on mild Alzheimer's; patients who still suffer from memory loss, but are not completely dependent on caregivers. Alzheimer’s disease is the most common type of dementia. In the early stage, noticeable symptoms may be minimal but the more it progresses the more damage the disease causes to the brain. While there are currently no treatments to stop Alzheimer's diseases’ progression, there have been different medications and treatments used to diminish its symptoms.

We expect this app to be used by informal caregivers alongside patients daily and we also expect the app to have the following functionalities.
  - **Journal:** Saving Memories. The journal, updated by all members, will provide loving memories of the family in the past and present.
  - **Reminders:** Notifications that are posted by the family members/caretakers to remind the patient about their current affairs.
  - **Specialized Checklist:** A to-do list where certain items can be checked off by people with permissions (a caretaker can be the only       one to check off if the patient has taken all the pills for the day).
  - **GPS Tracking:** Peace of Mind. The app provides real-time tracking for the safety of the patient, shared with all the linked devices       of family members/caretakers.
  - **Memory Prompting:** As Alzheimer's progress, language, reasoning, and processing are all affected. This affects the ability of the
    patient to remember certain words. We expect functionality to be implemented based on this idea.
  - **Brain Game:** Based on saved memories, it would prompt the patient to describe certain details about a memory.
  - **Permission-Based Viewing:** Not all family members need all the information. Check out the options for the devices that need certain
    info, or that don’t need all in the information.
      - **Revoking and granting access:** A primary admin will be able to assign/reassign appropriate rolls according to their liking.

## Identify stakeholders and users. Figure out who is impacted (in one way or another) by this system -- these are stakeholders. Note that stakeholders and users overlap, but are not always the same. For example, the primary users of self-checkout at a grocery store are customers, but cashiers still make use of the system, and the owner of a grocery store (who is likely paying for its installation) is someone who cares about the system, too. Create a list of these stakeholders, and describe them (particularly the users) in terms of: how much training/experience they might have, their background knowledge, etc.
  - Developers/Designers
      - the developers and designers will need lots of training to be able to implement this app to the best of their abilities, using
      research and IDEO methods. Their background knowledge may consist of personal background, but also secondary research from
      creating the best product possible.

## Secondary research
1. - Up to 75% of people living with dementia in the United States are cared for by family members in their homes
   - Dementia caregivers have higher levels of depression, anxiety and other mood disorders compared with caregivers of older adults          without dementia
   - Research has shown that technology-based interventions can improve these outcomes on all sides of the equation
   - Study focused on the effects of ICT interventions on the health of informal dementia caregivers
   - **Interventions studied (in the home)**
      - Care consultant
      - Helped to establish individualized plan of care which can include tasks such as utilizing Alzheimer’s Association services
      - Automated voice response system
      - Phone services like support groups, strategies to reduce disruptive behavior, and a distraction call for the care recipient
      - Videotapes with strategies to improve recipient’s dressing and eating skills, or skill training for the caregiver (coaching)
      - Exercise intervention
      - Physical fitness videos and phone sessions from behavior-change counsellors
      - ComputerLink system
      - Educational information, decision support, and communication features for communication between caregivers
          - Communication boards were also monitored by a nurse who would respond to messages.
      - Internet based program with eight components consisting of embedded educational video clip
     - Of the 12 interventions, ten targeted increasing caregiving support, one aimed to improve caregiver health, and one sought to
       improve caregiver's skills for resource utilization
     - 3 tech groups: telephone-, video-, and computer-based interventions
     - Half of the interventions studied were phone-based
     - Limited number of ICT interventions leading to a statistically significant effect on informal caregiver outcomes
     - However tech from all 3 groups described above appear to be successfully targeting caregiver support for a range of affective
       caregiver outcomes, including burden, depression, and anxiety
     - Evidence strongest for various forms of telephone-based interventions based on the quality of the studies and the effects of the
       interventions
     - Telephone can be used effectively stand-alone or in tandem with other ICTs
2. - Majority of carers were sons or daughters or spouses (majority of which were women)
   - Caregivers expressed a high level of satisfaction with both primary care and neurology clinics
3. - Table 61.1. The Philosophy of Assisted Living
      1. Offer personalized, cost-effective, quality supportive services in a safe residential environment.
      2. Maximize the independence of each resident.
      3. Treat each resident with dignity and respect.
      4. Promote the individuality of each resident.
      5. Protect each resident's right to privacy.
      6. Provide each resident the choice of services and lifestyles and the right to negotiate risk associated with that choice.
      7. Involve residents and include family and friends in service planning and implementation when requested by a competent resident
      or when appropriate for incompetent residents.
      8. Provide opportunity for residents to develop and maintain relationships in the broader community.
      9. Minimize the need to move.
      10. Involve residents in policy decisions affecting resident life.
      11. Make full consumer disclosure before move in.
      12. Ensure that potential residents are fully informed regarding the setting's approach and capacity to serve individuals with
      cognitive and physical impairments.
      13. Ensure that specialized programs (e.g., for residents with dementia) have a written statement of philosophy and mission
      reflecting how the setting can meet the specialized needs of the resident.
      14. Ensure that residents can receive health services provided as they would be within their own home.
      15. Ensure that assisted living, while health care–related, focuses primarily on a supportive environment designed to maintain an
      individual's ability to function independently for as long as possible.
      16. Ensure that assisted living, with its residential emphasis, avoids the visual and procedural characteristics of an
      “institutional” setting.
      17. Ensure that assisted living, with its focus on the customer, lends itself to personalized services emphasizing the particular
      needs of the individual and his/her choice of lifestyle. the watchwords should be “creativity,” “variety,” and “innovation.”

   - The term assisted living is commonly used by facilities that do not subscribe to this philosophy of providing a homelike
     environment, independence, autonomy, and privacy
   - As a result, there is no one accepted definition of assisted living
   - Services required or allowed under regulation in assisted living settings:
      - Medical services
      - Social services
      - Support services
      - Barber/salon
      - 3rd party services
      - Home health care
      - Skilled nursing
      - Therapy
      - Dietary consultation
      - Wound care
      - Medication management
      - Hospice
    - Issues with assisted living
      - Disparity in access and quality
      - Autonomy, negotiated risk, and aging in place
      - Resident choice vs safety
      - Recognizing and Treating Psychosocial Needs

## Task Descriptions
1. Setting up a Reminder
The primary caretaker can go into the application tap on set reminder. The app will ask her for the title of the reminder, a description, a picture if applicable, the time the reminder should go off, , the days of the week it will go off on, if the reminder is recurring or one time only and if its recurring how often should the reminder go off (weekly, monthly, yearly). Once all information has been filled in then the caretaker will can press save to go through with the set up or cancel if they decide it is not needed.

2. Adding a Journal entry
The user opens the journal page and a calendar opens up with the current date highlighted. The user cant then press on the day they want to add an entry to and it will take them to another screen with all the entries associated to that day. the user then presses on the add entry button and is taken to another screen where they enter a title, picture and/or files (if needed), location (not needed), time of day(not needed), date(if wants to change the day they clicked on),and a description of the the memory they want to save. Once the user has finished entering all the information they can proceed to press the save button where the entry will show up on the day they saved the entry on.

3. Editing Journal Entry
The user presses the day and entry they want to edit, they press the edit icon where it takes them to a page similar to journal entry page with all of the fields filled out. User can then choose whatever they want to add, subtract or change. After user has finished with the changes they submit save, a prompt comes up making sure they want to confirm the changes if the user agrees the entry will now show the correct information.

4. Editing Reminder
User goes into the reminders screen and can choose from all the saved reminders. When the user presses the desired reminder details of it show up, like the description. From there the user can click the edit button and go into the set-up reminder screen, with all the fields filled. The user can then change all their information, then press save to save the changes. A prompt will pop up to confirm any changes that the user did was intentional once the user confirms it was then the reminder will now display the correct information.

5. Playing Brain Game
The user goes to the brain game portal and can choose from a number of cards each one representing a game of some sort. The user chooses the game they want and can start playing right away. There will be an icon on the top left to go back to the game portal to choose another card or function.

## Treatments
There are drugs available that may help with some types of dementia and stop symptoms progressing for a while. This is one reason why it’s important to go to the GP as soon as you suspect there’s a problem.

Other things that can help with symptoms of dementia include:

- cognitive stimulation, which might involve doing word puzzles or discussing current affairs
- life story work, sharing memories and experiences with a carer or nurse to create a ‘life storybook’
- keeping as active as possible – physically, mentally and socially – which can boost memory and self-esteem, and help avoid depression
